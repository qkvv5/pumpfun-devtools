# PumpFun DevTools

PumpFun offers project assistance tools for crypto projects.

## Features

1. **Wallet Creation Instructions**: Easily create a wallet for tracking development or for micro-purchases. Save it in the root directory of the script.

2. **Dev Tracking - Insider Trading**: Monitor the Dev wallet addresses. Upon the coin pump, execute immediate buys using wallets from `Dev_wallets.txt`. Transaction amounts are randomly chosen within a range defined by minimum and maximum transaction values to better conceal insider trading.

3. **Micro Selling**: Input the contract address, set the transaction amount and interval. Utilize wallets from `Micro_wallets.txt` for continuous purchasing, ensuring constant exposure of your project on the Pumpfun homepage.
